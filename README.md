## About

This project is an interactive online store platform focused on delivering a smooth and responsive experience. It was developed based on the ["app-ideas" challenge by florinpop17](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas), following the proposed User Stories.

## Design (UI/UX)
Before writing any code, I prototyped the entire interface using Figma. This allowed me to ensure a clean and consistent layout across desktop devices.

## Technologies Used
React: Framework used for building a modular UI.<br>
TypeScript: Main language to ensure type safety and code reliability.<br>
SWC: High-performance compiler for a faster development workflow.<br>
CSS: Custom styling with a strong focus on responsiveness.

## Project Setup
